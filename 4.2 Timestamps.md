# 4.2 Timestamps

## 4.2.1 Motivation
In order to enable snapshotting based on time constraints rather than special messages in the Tangle (e.g. checkpoints), nodes need to share the same perception of time. Specifically, they need to have consensus on the *age of messages*. Therefore, messages contain a field `timestamp` which represents the creation time of the message and is signed by the issuing node. 

Having consensus on the creation time of messages enables not only total ordering but also new applications that require certain guarantees regarding time. Specicifically, we may use message timestamps to enforce timestamps in transactions, which may also be used in computing the mana associated to a particular node ID. 

In this document, we propose a mechanism achieving consensus on message timestamps by combining a synchronous and an asynchronous approach. While online nodes may leverage FPC to vote on timestamps, nodes that join the network at a later time use an approach based on the *approval weight* (described in section X.X) to determine the validity of timestamps. 

This specificiation also outlines a tool called epochs, which groups messages into different objective periods.  This tool may be used for the following purposes:
- **finality and approval weight:**  the activity of certain nodes within an epoch can be recorded, and then the approval weight (i.e. the number of nodes, weighted by consensus, which issued a message referencing a particular message) can then be measured as a percentage of "active consensus mana".
- **committee selection:** a committee elected as the highest active consensus mana holders can be easily and objectively formed for the DRNG committee. 
- **simplified payment verification (SPV):** Finality gadget statements could be used to enable (ad-hoc) nodes to verify the finality of messages without the need to download the entire Tangle. This feature may be implemented in the future. 

## 4.2.2 Preliminaries
### 4.2.2.1 Requirements
1. Nodes must have consensus on which messages are valid.
2. Nodes must have consensus on the timestamp assciated to each message.
3. For every time `t`, eventually, any new message issued with timestamp `t` will be too far in the past and will be orphaned.

### 4.2.2.2 Dependencies
+ Opinion Setting
+ FPC: used to perform voting on timestamps.
+ Approval weight: used to correct timestamps.


### 4.2.3.3 Modules dependent on timestamps
+ Tip selection: only messages with correct timestamps will be eligible for tip selection.
+ Active Consensus Mana in approval weight uses epochs.
+ DRNG uses Epochs.
+ The Congestion control orders messages by timestamps, and only processes messages whose timestamp is close to the current time.  
+ The rate control system uses timestamps to compute the correct PoWs.
+ The snapshotting uses timestamps to determine which messages to prune from the tangle.

### 4.2.2.5 Clock synchronization
Nodes need to share the same perception of time to fulfill `Requirement 1`. Therefore, we propose that nodes synchronize their clock on startup and resynchronize periodically every `60min` to counter [drift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock_drift) of local clocks. Instead of changing a nodes' system clock, we introduce an `offset` parameter to adjust for differences between *network time* and local time of a node. Initially, the [Network Time Protocol (NTP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Time_Protocol) ([Go implementation](https://github.com/beevik/ntp)) may be used to achieve this task. 

```go
var offset time.Duration

func FetchTimeOffset() {
    resp, err := ntp.Query("0.pool.ntp.org")
    if err != nil {
        handle(err)
    }
    offset = resp.ClockOffset
}

func SyncedTime() time.Time {
    return time.Now().Add(offset)
}
```

### 4.2.2.5 Failure to (re)sync clock
We gracefully shut down the node if:
- initial synchronization of time fails
- resynchronization fails for more than `maxSyncAttempts` times 

## 4.2.3 General Timestamp rules
In order for a message to be eligible for tip selection, the timestamp of every message in its past cone (both weak and strong) must satisfy certain requirements. These requirements fall into two categories: objective and subjective. The objective criteria only depend on information written directly in the tangle and is applied immediately upon solidification.  Thus all nodes immediately have consensus on the objective criteria.  In this section, we will discuss these objective criteria.

The quality of the timestamp is a subjective criterion since it is based on the solidification time of the message.  Thus, nodes must use a consens algorithm, e.g. FPC, to decide which messages should be rejected based on subjective criteria. Specifically, nodes will use FPC to vote on whether or not a timestamp is before `W` plus the arrival time. Therefore, we can guarantee that all timestamps are approximately correct.  

Consensus matters are not discussed in this document: see [SECTION] to discuss how FPC votes on timestamps. 

### 4.2.3.1 Age of parents
We need the tangle to grow forward: we do not want incoming messages to reference extremely old messages. If any new message may reference any message in the Tangle, then a node will need to keep all messages readily available, precluding snapshotting. Additionally, we want to enforce a partial order, i.e., parents need to be older than children.


### 4.2.3.2 Message timestamp vs transaction timestamp
Transactions contain a timestamp that is signed by the user when creating the transaction. It is thus different from the timestamp in the message which is created and signed by the node. We require 
```
transaction.timestamp+TW => messagetimestamp => transaction.timestamp
```
where `TW` defines the maximum allowed difference between both timestamps.

If a node receives a transaction from a user with an invalid timestamp it does not create a message but discards the transaction with a corresponding error message to the user. To prevent a user's local clock differences causing issues the node should offer an API endpoint to retrieve its `SyncedTime` according to the network time. 

### 4.2.3.3 Reattachments
Reattachments of a transaction are possible during the time window `TW`. Specifically, a transaction may be reattached in a new message as long as the condition `message.timestamp-TW =< transaction.timestamp` is fulfilled. If for some reason a transaction is not *picked up* (even after reattachment) and thus being orphaned, the user needs to create a new transaction with a current timestamp. 

### 4.2.3.4 Age of UTXO
Inputs to a transaction (unspent outputs) inherit their spent time from the transaction timestamp. Similarly, unspent outputs inherit their creation time from the transaction timestamp as well. For a transaction to be considered valid we require
```
transaction.timestamp => inputs.timestamp
```
In other words, all inputs to a transaction need to have a smaller or equal timestamp than the transaction. In turn, all created unspent outputs will have a greater or euqal timestamp than all inputs.




##  4.2.4 Epochs
Epochs are universal time intervals that group messages in the tangle based on their timestamps.
 - An epoch is identified by its unique epoch index. Epoch indices are strictly increasing with respect to time.
 - Every time interval `EPOCHLENGTH` , a new epoch is started and the previous ends.
 - A message `M` belongs to an `Epoch X`, if its timestamp falls into the time window of 
 `Epoch X` such that T(`M`)âˆˆ [t<sub>X-1</sub>, t<sub>X</sub>), where
   - T(`M`) is the timestamp of message `M`,
   - t<sub>x-1</sub> is the end of the previous epoch,
   - and t<sub>x</sub> is the end of `Epoch X`.
 - The start of the network corresponds to t<sub>1</sub>, that is the end of `Epoch 1`.
 - `Epoch 0` and `Epoch 1` are special epochs, since they only contain the genesis message(s), and their content is defined before starting the network. These two epochs might be used to initialize the network and active consensus mana states to a desired values.
 - For every network, the end of `Epoch 0` should be defined as an arbitrary point in time, similarly to how [Unix epoch time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time) is defined as 00:00:00 UTC on 1 January 1970.
 - Epoch interval `EPOCHLENGTH` should also be chosen arbitrarily: it should be much larger than `DELTA`.  Furthermore, short epochs can potentially cause make certain calculations involving the approval wait more complicated.

Figure 1 gives a brief overview of how the Tangle is divided into epochs:

`Epoch 0` contains the genesis message(s), that hold the genesis output(s). By allowing multiple outputs to exist before the start of the network, a desired initial state for the network can be set.
`Epoch 2` is the first epoch after the start of the network, when nodes may start issuing messages. Note, that a message can be valid with one strong parent only.

Upon processing a message and verifying its timestamp as described in [Opinion Setting Specification](), the message is solidified and can be added to the epoch. 
`Epoch 2` ends at t<sub>2</sub>, but it can happen that a message is issued just before t<sub>2</sub>, therefore it reaches most nodes and gets solidified during `Epoch 3`. In this case, the node can still determine the correct epoch the message belongs to due to the consensus on the message timestamp. This also means, that finalizing an epoch (declaring that no more messages can be added to it) is delayed after the end of the epoch by at least `W` time.


## 4.2.5 Limitations
- When not in sync, a different behaviour is required which complicates the protocol.
- Using NTP as clock synchronization mechanism as proposed is a single point of failure. It can only be considered as an initial implementation into GoShimmer and needs to be replaced by a decentralized alternative.
