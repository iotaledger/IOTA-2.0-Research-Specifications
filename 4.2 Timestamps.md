# 4.2 Timestamps

## 4.2.1 Motivation
In order to enable snapshotting based on time constraints rather than special messages in the Tangle (e.g. checkpoints), nodes need to share the same perception of time. Specifically, they need to have consensus on the *age of messages*. Therefore, messages contain a field `timestamp` which represents the creation time of the message and is signed by the issuing node. 

Having consensus on the creation time of messages enables not only total ordering but also new applications that require certain guarantees regarding time. Specicifically, we may use message timestamps to enforce timestamps in transactions, which may also be used in computing the mana associated to a particular node ID. 

In this document, we propose a mechanism achieving consensus on message timestamps by combining a synchronous and an asynchronous approach. While online nodes may leverage FPC to vote on timestamps, nodes that join the network at a later time use an approach based on the *approval weight* (described in section X.X) to determine the validity of timestamps. 

This specificiation also outlines a tool called epochs, which groups messages into different objective periods.  This tool may be used for the following purposes:
- **finality and approval weight:**  the activity of certain nodes within an epoch can be recorded, and then the approval weight (i.e. the number of nodes, weighted by consensus, which issued a message referencing a particular message) can then be measured as a percentage of "active consensus mana".
- **committee selection:** a committee elected as the highest active consensus mana holders can easily be formed for the DRNG committee. 
- **simplified payment verification (SPV):** Finality gadget statements could be used to enable (ad-hoc) nodes to verify the finality of messages without the need to download the entire Tangle. This feature may be implemented in the future. 

## 4.2.2 Preliminaries
### 4.2.2.1 Requirements
1. Nodes must have consensus on which messages are valid.
2. Nodes must have consensus on the timestamp assciated to each message.
3. For every time `t`, eventually, any new message issued with timestamp `t` will be too far in the past and will be orphaned.

### 4.2.2.2 Dependencies
+ FPC: used to perform voting on timestamps.
+ Approval weight: used to correct timestamps.


### 4.2.3.3 Modules dependent on timestamps
+ Active Consensus Mana in approval weight uses epochs.
+ DRNG uses Epochs.
+ The Congestion control orders messages by timestamps, and only processes messages whose timestamp is close to the current time.  
+ The rate control system uses timestamps to compute the correct PoWs.
+ The snapshotting uses timestamps to determine which messages to prune from the tangle.

### 4.2.2.4 Parameters
- `D` network delay ~15 seconds. We assume all messages are delivered to most nodes within this time with high probability.
- `w` window ~1 minute. Require w>2D.
- `Delta` max age difference in consecutive timestamps. Require Delta>w+D.
- `tw` max difference between message timestamp and transaction timestamp.
- `EpochLength` the length of each epoch ~ 1 hour


### 4.2.2.5 Clock synchronization
Nodes need to share the same perception of time to fulfill `Requirement 1`. Therefore, we propose that nodes synchronize their clock on startup and resynchronize periodically every `60min` to counter [drift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock_drift) of local clocks. Instead of changing a nodes' system clock, we introduce an `offset` parameter to adjust for differences between *network time* and local time of a node. Initially, the [Network Time Protocol (NTP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Time_Protocol) ([Go implementation](https://github.com/beevik/ntp)) may be used to achieve this task. 

```go
var offset time.Duration

func FetchTimeOffset() {
    resp, err := ntp.Query("0.pool.ntp.org")
    if err != nil {
        handle(err)
    }
    offset = resp.ClockOffset
}

func SyncedTime() time.Time {
    return time.Now().Add(offset)
}
```

### 4.2.2.5 Failure to (re)sync clock
We gracefully shut down the node if:
- initial synchronization of time fails
- resynchronization fails for more than `3` times 

## 4.2.3 General Timestamp rules
Before a message may obtain `eligibility` status, i.e., becoming a valid tip and therefore part of the Tangle, it needs to fulfill certain criteria regarding its timestamp.

### 4.2.3.1 Age of parents
We need the tangle to grow forward: we do not want incoming messages to reference extremely old messages. If any new message may reference any message in the Tangle, then a node will need to keep all messages readily available, precluding snapshotting. Additionally, we want to enforce a partial order, i.e., parents need to be older than children.


### 4.2.3.2 Message timestamp vs transaction timestamp
Transactions contain a timestamp that is signed by the user when creating the transaction. It is thus different from the timestamp in the message which is created and signed by the node. We require 
```
message.timestamp-tw < transaction.timestamp < message.timestamp
```
where `tw` defines the maximum allowed difference between both timestamps.

If a node receives a transaction from a user with an invalid timestamp it does not create a message but discards the transaction with a corresponding error message to the user. To prevent a user's local clock differences causing issues the node should offer an API endpoint to retrieve its `SyncedTime` according to the network time. 

### 4.2.3.3 Reattachments
Reattachments of a transaction are possible during the time window `tw`. Specifically, a transaction may be reattached in a new message as long as the condition `message.timestamp-tw < transaction.timestamp` is fulfilled. If for some reason a transaction is not *picked up* (even after reattachment) and thus being orphaned, the user needs to create a new transaction with a current timestamp. 

### 4.2.3.4 Age of UTXO
Inputs to a transaction (unspent outputs) inherit their spent time from the transaction timestamp. Similarly, unspent outputs inherit their creation time from the transaction timestamp as well. For a transaction to be considered valid we require
```
inputs.timestamp < transaction.timestamp
```
In other words, all inputs to a transaction need to have a smaller timestamp than the transaction. In turn, all created unspent outputs will have a greater timestamp than all inputs.

## 4.2.4 Consensus
The timestamp should define the time when the message was created and issued to the Tangle, and this must be enforced to some degree through voting. Specifically, nodes will vote on whether the timestamp is not older than `w` of the current local time. This time window is large to account for the network delay. In order to have consensus on the validity of the timestamp, and hence the validity of the message, we use [FPC](Link) voting, along with the levels of knowledge.  

Clearly, in order to have a correct perception of the timestamp quality, **we assume the node is in sync** (see section [Not in Sync](#Not_in_Sync) otherwise).
Voting on timestamps should not occur for every messsage. Specifically, only for those that arrive around the border of the threshold +-`w`.


### 4.2.4.1 Setting the initial opinion

The opinion of timestamp is stored according to the rules laid out in the [Objects of voting](link) specification.  The opinion is set by the module called the `OpininionManager`: see [Dataflow](Link). When setting the opinion, the feild `timeFormed' is set to the solidification time.   Refer to the [FPC](Link) specification to see how the voting actually takes place.  

The initial opinion and level of knowledge are set according to the following rule:

```
If arrivalTime+w>currenTime 
    Then opinion <- LIKE
    Else opinion <- DISLIKE
If ||arrivalTime-currenTime|-w|<D 
    Then level <- 1
Else If ||arrivalTime-currenTime|-w|<2D
    Then level <- 2
Else level <- 3
```

![](https://i.imgur.com/a5or78c.png)

For example, lets set `w` and `D` to 1 minute and 15 seconds respectively. Let's assume that the current time is 12:00:00 and we have to evaluate a new message with timestamp set at 11:59:45. Since |11:59:45-12:00:00| < 1 minute, we will set the opinion to `LIKE`. Moreover, since ||11:59:45-12:00:00| - 1 minute | is greater than 15 seconds, and also grater than 2*15 seconds, we will set the level of knowledge for this opinion to 3 (i.e., the supermajority of the network should already have the same opinion).

Lets consider now a new message with timestamp 11:59:10. Since |11:59:10-12:00:00| < 1 minute we will set the opinion to `LIKE`. However, since ||11:59:10-12:00:00| - 1 minutes | is lower than 15 seconds, we will set the level of knowledge for this opinion to 1, meaning that this message timestamp will be object of voting. 

In general, timestamps with level-of-knowledge 1 will be input into FPC, that will eventually trigger the `finalized` event, after which we may set a message as eligible (or discard, depending on the outcome). If instead, the timestamp we are considering, has already level of knowledge >= 2, we do not need to vote, but we will reply to queries. Either it is eligible (marked as liked) or marked as disliked. If the timestamp has level-of-knowledge 3 we do not reply to FPC queries.




### 4.2.4.2 Not in Sync
Any node not in sync will have a wrong perception about the quality of timestamps. Thus, the idea is to not actively participate in any voting until its status is in sync.
Moreover, if a timestamp has been marked as `disliked` by the network, the message would get orphaned and the syncing node would not receive it from honest neighbors, even if it is approved with a weak referance. 
In general, a node that just completed the syncing phase should check, for each message, how much mana is in its future cone and set the opinion accordingly.

More specifically:

1. Run the solidification up to being in sync (by following beacons)
2. Derive local markers
3. Decide elegibility for every message (5-10% mana min threshold)

Clearly this synchronization procedures may only work to make an apparently bad timestamp reset to be a good timestamp.  For example, if we receive a message later, and think a timestamp is older than it actually is, the resync mechanism will tell us it is correct. 

What about the converse situation? If a node locally thinks a timestamp is good, is there any way that the timestamp can actually be bad? If a node receives a message with  a good timestamp, it will forward on to its neighbors, and the message will then reach most of the network within `D` time.  Thus, either all nodes will also see the timestamp will be good, or else, the levels of knowlege will force a vote on the timestamp.  In either case, the node will come to the correct opinion about the timestamp.



### 4.2.4.3 Future Timestamps

Note that the resync mechanism only works because we only dislike a message if it is too old.  If we disliked messages whose timestamp was in the future, then it is possible that some nodes would like it, and others disliked it.  Suppose for example at 11:00:00 a node issues a message `X` with timestamp 12:00:00, and that then all nodes rejected this timestamp for being too far in the future.  Now suppose at 12:00:00 a new node `N` joins the network at recieves `X`.  According to node `N`, the timestamp of `X` is valid, and will accept it, while other nodes will reject it.  The resyncronization mechanism fails in this case.  

To protect agains messages with a timestamp that is issued in the future, the [congestion control algorith](Link) does not schedule the message untill the time is within `w` of `currentTime`. Thus messages from the future will not be added to the tangle untill the appropriate time. If an attacker sends too many future message, they may try to overlaod the scheduler's queues. However, this is a standard type of attack that the congestion control algorithm is prepared to handle.  

Alternatively, because the messages will be rebroadcasted by other the neighbors when the timestamp is good, a node may reject messages which are egregiously far in the future without sacrificing consistancy. However, this is an implementation detail.  



##  4.2.4 Epochs
Epochs are universal time intervals that group messages in the tangle based on their timestamps.
 - An epoch is identified by its unique epoch index. Epoch indices are strictly increasing with respect to time.
 - Every time interval `EpochLength` , a new epoch is started and the previous ends.
 - A message `M` belongs to an `Epoch X`, if its timestamp falls into the time window of 
 `Epoch X` such that T(`M`)∈ [t<sub>X-1</sub>, t<sub>X</sub>), where
   - T(`M`) is the timestamp of message `M`,
   - t<sub>x-1</sub> is the end of the previous epoch,
   - and t<sub>x</sub> is the end of `Epoch X`.
 - The start of the network corresponds to t<sub>1</sub>, that is the end of `Epoch 1`.
 - `Epoch 0` and `Epoch 1` are special epochs, since they only contain the genesis message(s), and their content is defined before starting the network. These two epochs might be used to initialize the network and active consensus mana states to a desired values.
 - For every network, the end of `Epoch 0` should be defined as an arbitrary point in time, similarly to how [Unix epoch time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time) is defined as 00:00:00 UTC on 1 January 1970.
 - Epoch interval `EpochLength` should also be chosen arbitrarily: it should be much larger than `Delta`.  Furthermore, short epochs can potentially cause make certain calculations involving the approval wait more complicated.

Figure 1 gives a brief overview of how the Tangle is divided into epochs:

![](https://i.imgur.com/5mZYAO8.png)


`Epoch 0` contains the genesis message(s), that hold the genesis output(s). By allowing multiple outputs to exist before the start of the network, a desired initial state for the network can be set.
`Epoch 2` is the first epoch after the start of the network, when nodes may start issuing messages. Note, that a message can be valid with one strong parent only.

Upon processing a message and verifying its timestamp as described in [Timestamp Specification](https://github.com/iotaledger/goshimmer/pull/742), the message is solidified and can be added to the epoch. 
`Epoch 2` ends at t<sub>2</sub>, but it can happen that a message is issued just before t<sub>2</sub>, therefore it reaches most nodes and gets solidified during `Epoch 3`. In this case, the node can still determine the correct epoch the message belongs to due to the consensus on the message timestamp. This also means, that finalizing an epoch (declaring that no more messages can be added to it) is delayed after the end of the epoch by at least `w` time.


## 4.2.5 Limitations
- When not in sync, a different behaviour is required which complicates the protocol.
- Using NTP as clock synchronization mechanism as proposed is a single point of failure. It can only be considered as an initial implementation into GoShimmer and needs to be replaced by a decentralized alternative.
