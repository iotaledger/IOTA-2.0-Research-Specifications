# 4.4 Solidification
A message is solid if all its parents are stored, solid and valid. This section defines how messages get solid in the Tangle.

## 4.4.1 Motivation
**Solidification** is a process of requesting missing referenced messages. It may be recursively repeated until all of a message's past cone up to the genesis (or snapshot) becomes solid.

In that way, the Tangle enables all nodes to retrieve all of a message's history, even the ones joining the network at a point later in time.

## 4.4.2 Definitions
* **valid**: A message is considered valid if it passes the following filters from the solidifier and from the message booker:
    * solidifier: it checks if parents are valid,
    * booker: it check if the contained transaction is valid. Notice that only messages containing a transaction are required to perform this check..
> TODO: link to message layout semantic check, and transaction syntactic/semantic check in ledgerstate spec.
* **parents age check**: A check that ensures the timestamps of parents and child are valid, following the details defined in Timestamp specification [Parent age check](#parent-age-check) 
> TODO: put the link of timestamp check
* **solid**: A message is solid if it passes parents age check and all its parents are stored in the storage, solid and valid.

## 4.4.3 Parameters 
* `retryInterval`: The time interval of resending the same solidification request.
* `maxRequestThreshold`: The maximum retry times to send a solidification request.

## 4.4.4 Detailed Design
During solidification, if a node is missing a referenced message, the corresponding message ID is stored in the `solidification buffer`. A node asks its neighbors for the missing message by sending a `solidification request` containing the message ID. Once the requested message is received from its neighbors, its message ID shall be removed from the `solidification buffer`. The requested message is marked as solid after it passes the standard solidification checks. If any of the checks fails, the message remains unsolid. 

If a message gets solid, it shall walk through the rest of the data flow, then propagate the solid status its future cone by performing the solidification checks on each of the message in its future cone again.

Figure 4.4.4.1 shows the solidification process:

## 4.4.5 Communication details
Nodes send and receive `solidification request/response` via gossip layer. The `solidification request` is created and scheduled by the gossip manager, if a node does not get the requested message, the gossip manager resends it every `retryInterval`. If the requested message is not received within `maxRequestThreshold` rounds, the `solidification request` must be removed from the `solidification buffer`.

### 4.4.5.1 Request and response
Below we define the form of SolidificationRequest and SolidificationResponse: 

### SolidificationRequest
<table>
     <tr>
         <th>Name</th>
         <th>Type</th>
         <th>Description</th>
     </tr>
     <tr>
         <td>type</td>
         <td>uint8</td>
         <td>Indicates that the packet is SolidificationRequest.</td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
         <td>messageID</td>
         <td>ByteArray[32]</td>
         <td>Contains the message ID of the requested message.</td>
     </tr>
 </table>

### SolidificationResponse
<table>
     <tr>
         <th>Name</th>
         <th>Type</th>
         <th>Description</th>
     </tr>
     <tr>
         <td>type</td>
         <td>uint8</td>
         <td>Indicates that the packet is SolidificationResponse.</td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
         <td>message</td>
         <td>ByteArray</td>
         <td>Contains the entire requested message.</td>
     </tr>
 </table>


 ## 4.4.6 Denial of Service
All requests/responses exchanged during the solidification are sent via UDP. As such, any UDP based Denial of Service attack may harm the normal functionality of the solidification. To limit this, hardware based protection such as firewall or alternatively may be used.
