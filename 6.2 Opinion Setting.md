# 6.2 Opinion Setting

## 6.2.1 Preliminaries

### 6.2.1.2 Motivation

FPC is a binary voting protocol which takes a series of initial boolean values, and outputs a final value: see [???](). Specification [???]() describes how FPC interacts with other modules in the protocol, specifically how the functions `QueryStatus` and `AnswerStatus` react to the metadata `opinionField`. Moreover, the FPC specification, [???](), describes how the `opinionField` is updated when FPC terminates.

We need to describe how to set the initial opinion and how to trigger FPC voting. Specifically, we need to describe how the metadata `opinionField` is initially set.  Since the outcome of FPC respects a supermajority of initial opinions, it is important the the initial opinion is set correctly.  For example, if 90% of nodes (weighted by consensus mana) initially want to accept a transaction, then FPC will do just that.  




### 6.2.1.3 Summary

In this specification, we describe how the Opinion Setter, see [???](), initially sets `opinionField` metadata for every object being voted upon.  Specifically, the opinion setter writes
+ The initial opinion, i.e. the initial boolean value
+ The level of knowledge which dictates when FPC will be triggered
+ The time the opinion was formed 
See [???]() for a detailed explanation of these fields. 

As discussed in  [???](), FPC can potentially vote on two main object types:
+ transactions in order to determine conflicts
+ timestamps or order to judge timestamps

We split this specification into two main sections: the first dealing with setting the opinion on messages and their timestamp, and the second on setting the opinion on transactions.  

With regards to timestamps, we vote on whether or not the timestamp is "too old" when it arrives.  As with voting on transactions, we can reset this opinion using the approval weight even if the node is out os sync.  

We judge transactions based on the FCoB rule, which stands for Fast Consensus of Barcelona, in honor of the research summit where the rule was first defined.  A transaction `X` satisfied the FCoB rule if the node has not received any transactions conflicting with `X` before `arrivalTime(X)+C` where `C` is the FCoB parameter.  Recall from [???]() that two transactions conflict if the consume the same UTXO outputs. 

Intuitively, the FCoB rule only accepts a transaction if it has arrived significantly before any other conflict.  The FCoB rule guarantees that if one transaction is liked by a significant number of nodes (weighted by consensus mana), that all other conflicting transactions will be initially disliked by a supermajority of nodes, and thus rejected by FPC, guaranteeing that no two conflicting messages will be approved by FPC.However, this rule is slightly modified in practice so that we do not accidentally lock any funds.

## 6.2.2 Timestamps

The timestamp should define the time when the message was created and issued to the Tangle, and this must be enforced to some degree through voting. Specifically, nodes will vote on whether the timestamp is not older than `w` of the current local time. This time window is large to account for the network delay. In order to have consensus on the validity of the timestamp, and hence the validity of the message, we use [FPC](Link) voting, along with the levels of knowledge.  

Clearly, in order to have a correct perception of the timestamp quality, **we assume the node is in sync** (see section [Not in Sync](#Not_in_Sync) otherwise).
Voting on timestamps should not occur for every message. Specifically, only for those that arrive around the border of the threshold +-`w`.


### 6.2.2.1 Setting the initial opinion

In this section, we describe how the `opinionField` is set for messages, and how we achieve consensus on the quality of timestamps. 

The opinion of timestamp is stored according to the rules laid out in the [Objects of voting](link) specification.  The opinion is set by the module called the `OpinionManager`: see [Dataflow](Link). When setting the opinion, the field `timeFormed' is set to the solidification time.   Refer to the [FPC](Link) specification to see how the voting actually takes place.  

The initial opinion and level of knowledge are set according to the following rule:

```
vbnet
IF arrivalTime+w >= currenTime  THEN
    opinion = LIKE
ELSE 
    opinion = DISLIKE
IF ||arrivalTime - currenTime |-w| => DLARGE THEN 
    level = 1
ELSE IF ||arrivalTime - currenTime |-w| => 2*DLARGE THEN
    level = 2
ELSE 
    level = 3
```

![](https://i.imgur.com/a5or78c.png)

For example, lets set `w` and `D` to 1 minute and 15 seconds respectively. Let's assume that the current time is 12:00:00 and we have to evaluate a new message with timestamp set at 11:59:45. Since |11:59:45-12:00:00| < 1 minute, we will set the opinion to `LIKE`. Moreover, since ||11:59:45-12:00:00| - 1 minute | is greater than 15 seconds, and also grater than 2*15 seconds, we will set the level of knowledge for this opinion to 3 (i.e., the supermajority of the network should already have the same opinion).

Lets consider now a new message with timestamp 11:59:10. Since |11:59:10-12:00:00| < 1 minute we will set the opinion to `LIKE`. However, since ||11:59:10-12:00:00| - 1 minutes | is lower than 15 seconds, we will set the level of knowledge for this opinion to 1, meaning that this message timestamp will be object of voting. 

In general, timestamps with level-of-knowledge 1 will be input into FPC, that will eventually trigger the `finalized` event, after which we may set a message as eligible (or discard, depending on the outcome). If instead, the timestamp we are considering, has already level of knowledge >= 2, we do not need to vote, but we will reply to queries. Either it is eligible (marked as liked) or marked as disliked. If the timestamp has level-of-knowledge 3 we do not reply to FPC queries.




### 6.2.2.2 Not in Sync
Any node not in sync will have a wrong perception about the quality of timestamps. Thus, the idea is to not actively participate in any voting until its status is in sync. Moreover, if a timestamp has been marked as `disliked` by the network, the message would get orphaned and the syncing node would not receive it from honest neighbors, even if it is approved with a weak reference. 
In general, a node that just completed the syncing phase should check, for each message, how much mana is in its future cone and set the opinion accordingly.

More specifically:
1. Run the solidification up to being in sync (by following beacons)
2. Derive local markers
3. Decide eligibility for every message (5-10% mana min threshold)

Clearly this synchronization procedure may only work to make an apparently bad timestamp reset to be a good timestamp.  For example, if we receive a message later, and think a timestamp is older than it actually is, the resync mechanism will tell us it is correct. 

What about the converse situation? If a node locally thinks a timestamp is good, is there any way that the timestamp can actually be bad? If a node receives a message with  a good timestamp, it will forward on to its neighbors, and the message will then reach most of the network within `D` time.  Thus, either all nodes will also see the timestamp will be good, or else, the levels of knowledge will force a vote on the timestamp.  In either case, the node will come to the correct opinion about the timestamp.



### 6.2.2.3 Future Timestamps

Note that the resync mechanism only works because we only dislike a message if it is too old.  If we disliked messages whose timestamp was in the future, then it is possible that some nodes would like it, and others disliked it.  Suppose for example at 11:00:00 a node issues a message `X` with timestamp 12:00:00, and that then all nodes rejected this timestamp for being too far in the future.  Now suppose at 12:00:00 a new node `N` joins the network at receives `X`.  According to node `N`, the timestamp of `X` is valid, and will accept it, while other nodes will reject it.  The resynchronization mechanism fails in this case.  

To protect against messages with a timestamp that is issued in the future, the [congestion control algorithm](Link) does not schedule the message until the timestamp is less than or equal to `w+currentTime`. Thus messages from the future will not be added to the tangle until the appropriate time. If an attacker sends too many future message, they may try to overload the scheduler's queues. However, this is a standard type of attack that the congestion control algorithm is prepared to handle.  

Alternatively, because the messages will be rebroadcasted by other neighbors when the timestamp is good, a node may reject messages which are egregiously far in the future without sacrificing consistency. However, this is an implementation detail.  



## 6.2.3 Transactions and FCoB

In this section, we discuss how to set the `opinionField` on transactions: specifically we discuss the FCoB rule.  Recall that A transaction `X` satisfied the FCoB rule if the node has not received any transactions conflicting with `X` before `arrivalTime(X)+C`.

### 6.2.3.1 Function which sets the opinion

We now define the function `FCOB` which decides the opinion of the transaction.  When setting the opinion, the node simply sets `opinionField=FCOB(transactionID)`.  
```vbnet
FUNCTION (bool,level,time)=FCOB(transactionID)
time=currentTime
IF transactionID is NOT a conflict
    bool = TRUE
    IF currentTime <= transactionIF.arrivalTime + C + DSMALL
        level = 1
    ELSE IF currentTime <= transactionIF.arrivalTime + C + 2DSMALL
        level = 2
    ELSE 
        level = 3
ELSE IF FORALL x conflicting with transactionID with x.arrivalTime <= transactionID.arrivalTime + C, x.opinionField.opinion == FALSE AND  x.opinionField.level == 2 or 3
        bool = TRUE
        level = 1
ELSE 
    conflictTime= MIN(x.arrivalTime FORALL x conflicting with transactionID)
    IF transaction.arrivalTime + C <= conflictTIme 
        bool = TRUE
    ELSE
        bool = FALSE
    If |transaction.arrivalTime + C - conflictTIme| <= DSMALL
        level = 1
    ELSE IF |transaction.arrivalTime + C - conflictTIme| <= 2DSMALL
        level = 2
    ELSE
        level = 3
RETURN (bool,level,timeFormed)
```
We now will explain the logical behind this function.  There are three cases which are treated:
1. No conflicts have been detected
2. Conflicts have been detected but have been rejected
3. Conflicts have been detected are either pending or have been confirmed

Case 3 is the simplest case: since conflicts have been detected, we set the opinion according to the FCOB rule.  Then then level is set according to the difference of `transaction.arrivalTime + C` and  `conflictTime`, the oldest arrival time of a conflicting transaction.  Essentially, the level measures how many network delays are between these two values.   

In Case 1 is the most common because for most transactions, conflicts will never arrive. Without conflicts, the FCOB rule technically is not defined. Therefore, the opinion is given provisionally: the opinion is set to true, but the level is set as if a conflict arrived at that time.   For example, after  `C + DSMALL` time has elapsed since arrival time, if a conflict does arrive the opinion will remain true with level at least 2.  

Lastly, Case 2 is an important modification of the FCoB rule. To see the need for this modification consider the following example.  Suppose someone issues a pair of conflicting transactions which are rejected both rejected by FPC.  Then, if someone ever issues a new transaction consuming those funds, FCoB, strictly speaking would reject the new transaction, since it would conflict with a previous transaction.  Thus, if a pair of double spends are rejected, the funds would be locked.  This is undesirable and impractical behavior: an honest but malfunctioning wallet can issue double spends.  Moreover, tracking the locked funds would be onerous. 

To prevent the FCoB rule from locking funds, we modify it to the following: a transaction `X` satisfied the FCoB rule if all transactions Y conflicting with `X`  before `arrivalTime(X)+C` has been rejected, i.e. has has opinion false and level 2 or 3.  With this rule, any conflicts which are rejected will not affect the opinion on future conflicts.  For simplicity case, all transactions falling under this case are treated as level 1.



### 6.2.3.2 When to set the opinion

The protocol is actually flexible on which time the opinion field of a transaction is set, and is mostly an implementation detail.  However, there are a few restrictions.
+ The transaction must be first booked.  When the transaction is booked, the node searches for conflicts, and if a conflict exists the node either creates a new conflict set or else it adds the transaction to an old conflict sets.  If the `FCoB` function is called before the transaction is booked, it will be impossible to tell what conflicts exist.
+ At times `transactionID.arrivalTime + C + DSMall` and `transactionID.arrivalTime + C + 2DSMall`, the opinion field would either be unchanged if reset at that particular time or there was no conflict detected and the opinion field is `NULL`. 

There are a plethora of ways this could be implemented.  We give two examples.  

First, after a messages are booked, its transaction, say `transactionID` is added to a timed queue.  At `transactionID.arrivalTime + C + DSMall` the opinion is set, and then either the transaction is rejected (i.e. bad with level 2 or 3), voted upon (level 1), or goes to tip selection (good level 2).   If no conflict has been detected, the transaction (i.e. the transaction is good level 2), the transaction is put in another timed queue.  At time `transactionID.arrivalTime + C + 2DSMall` the opinion is reset.  Note, once a conflict is detected the opinion field would not change, and so only transactions which are not part of conflict sets need to enter the second timed queue.

Second, while a transaction is being booked, if a conflict is detected, the opinion field can be immediately for all the new conflicts that were discovered.  This would include the transaction itself and any members of its conflict set which previously had a `NULL` opinion field.  This implementation has a few caveats:
+ Any transaction with a `NULL` opinion field must be treated as a "good" transaction.  At any time, the appropriate level of knowledge could be computed by looking at the arrival time.
+ Before the monotonically liked flag is set, the transaction must be at least `transactionID.arrivalTime + C + DSMall` and have either opinion field `NULL` or (good, level 2 or 3). 

Although this is an implementation detail, we remark that after a transaction is booked, it is easy to see if a message is a conflict or not.  Indeed, when a conflict is detected, a new branch is created, and the ID of that new branch is the same as the transactionID.  Thus a transaction is a conflict if and only if  `transactionID = transactionID.branchID`.  See [???]().

### 6.2.3.3 Questions

1. Suppose transaction `A` and `B` conflict and undergo FPC voting. Suppose then someone then issues `C` which conflicts with those transactions at the time the FPC voting is concluding.  Some nodes will receive `C` before the voting has concluded, and other nodes will receive `C` afterwards.  Nodes in the first group will initially have the opinion  (bad, level 3) where as the nodes in the second group will have opinion (good level 1).  In this case, the first group will not vote, and after the second group performs FPC, they will approve `C`.  Thus the network will not agree.  The approval weight will sort this issue out, but the situation is less than optimal.  
2. Suppose a transaction is orphaned. This event should be rare, but might not be impossible.  After the timestamp expires, it cannot be reattached.  Thus, the funds are locked, because any transaction arriving later will be considered a conflict.  As discussed above, this is not desirable behavior.
