The Tangle is a generalized Directed Acyclic (multi)Graph, with messages as vertices, and marked edges (marks \in\{0,1\}, 0 for weak, 1 for strong) to link messages.
The acyclicity condition means that there is no cycle composed of edges of arbitrary type.
We say that (a message) $x$ _strongly approves_ y if there is a directed path of strong edges from $x$ to $y$; $x$ weakly approves $y$ if there is a directed path of edges of any type from $x$ to $y$. Each message has a possible number of outgoing edges from 1 to 8 (with 2 as a default value).
The strong past cone of $x$ is the set of all messages strongly approved by $x$; the weak past cone of $x$ is the set of all messages weakly approved by $x$.
We assume that there is exactly one message (called the _genesis_) with no outgoing edges and that the genesis is in the weak past cone of every other message (so that the Tangle is connected in that sense).
