# 4.1 The Tangle

This specification describes the data structure used in the IOTA protocol, and introduces its main terminology.

## 4.1.1 Description

The Tangle represents a growing partially-ordered set of messages, linked with each other through cryptographic primitives, and replicated to all nodes in the peer-to-peer network. The Tangle enables the ledger state (i.e., the UTXO-DAG formed by transactions contained in messages) and the possibility to store data.

In mathematical terms, the Tangle is a Directed Acyclic (multi)Graph, with messages as vertices, and labelled directed edges (labels in \{0,1\}, 0 for weak, 1 for strong) to link messages via their cryptographic hashes (we refer to the next subsection 4.1.2.1 for the description of weak/strong edges).
The acyclicity condition means that there is no directed cycle composed of edges of arbitrary type.

## 4.1.2 Definitions

### 4.1.2.1 Approvals

If a message $x$ has a directed strong (resp. weak) edge to $y$, we say that $y$ is _strong_ (resp. _weak_) _parent_ of $x$, and $x$ is the _strong_ (resp. _weak_) _approver_ of $y$. More generally, we say that a message $x$ _strongly approves_ $y$ if there is a directed path of strong edges from $x$ to $y$, and $x$ _(weakly) approves_ $y$ if there is a directed path of edges of any type from $x$ to $y$.

Similarly, we say that the _strong past cone_ of $x$ is the set of all messages strongly approved by $x$, and the _(weak) past cone_ of $x$ is the set of all messages weakly approved by $x$. 
Furthermore, we define the _future cone_ of a message $x$ as the set of messages that weakly approve $x$. Please note that, unlike its past cone, the future cone of a message changes over time. A message which has not been approved yet is called _tip_.

In short, strong approvals are equivalent to the approvals in the legacy IOTA: if $x$ strongly approves $y$, it approves also $y$'s past cone. Moreover, weak approvals emulate the [White Flag](https://github.com/iotaledger/protocol-rfcs/blob/master/text/0005-white-flag/0005-white-flag.md) approach from Chrysalis: approving a message does not necessarily approve its past cone. This feature allows, for instance, two conflicting messages to be part of the Tangle without creating unmergeable branches.

Each message has a possible number of outgoing edges from 1 to 8 (with 2 as a default value), where at least one is a strong edge.
We assume that there is exactly one message, called the _genesis_, with no outgoing edges and that the genesis is in the weak past cone of every other message. The genesis creates the entire token supply and no other tokens will ever be created or, equivalently, no mining occurs.

### 4.1.2.2 Solidification

Due to the asynchronicity of the network, we may receive messages for which their past cone is not known yet. We refer to these messages as _unsolid_ messages. It is not possible neither to approve nor to gossip unsolid messages. The actions required to obtain such missing messages is called _solidification procedure_, and are described in detail in Section 4.4 - Solidification.

### 4.1.2.3 Example

In the figure below it is shown an example of the Tangle (strong edges are with a continuous line, weak edges are with a dotted line). Message $D$ contains a transaction that has been rejected. Thus, in the legacy IOTA, its future cone must be orphaned due to the monotonicity rule. In particular, both messages $E$ (data) and $F$ (transaction) directly reference $D$. In Coordicide, the introduction of weak/strong approvals allows that these messages can be picked up via a weak approval, as messages $G$ and $H$ show.
