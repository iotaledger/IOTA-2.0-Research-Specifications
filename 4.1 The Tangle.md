The Tangle is a generalized Directed Acyclic (multi)Graph, with messages as vertices, and with two types of directed edges, strong and weak. The acyclicity condition means that there is no cycle composed of edges of arbitrary type. We say that (a message) x strongly approves y if there is a directed path of strong edges from x to y; x weakly approves y if there is a directed path of edges of any type from x to y. The strong past cone of x is the set of all messages strongly approved by x; the weak past cone of x is the set of all messages weakly approved by x. We assume that there is exactly one message (called the genesis) with no outgoing edges and that the genesis is in the weak past cone of every other message (so that the Tangle is connected in that sense).
