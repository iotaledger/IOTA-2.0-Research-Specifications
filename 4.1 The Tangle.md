# 4.1 The Tangle

This specification describes the data structure used in the IOTA protocol, and introduces its main terminology.

## 4.1.1 Description

The Tangle represents a growing partially-ordered set of messages, linked with each other through cryptographic primitives, and replicated to all nodes in the peer-to-peer network. The Tangle enables the possibility to store data and to keep a ledger, the latter being based on UTXO-DAG formed by transactions contained in messages) and the possibility to store data.

In mathematical terms, the Tangle is a Directed Acyclic (multi)Graph with messages as vertices and directed edges as references to existing messages.
Directed edges are labelled: $0$ represents direct references flagged as _weak_, and $1$ represents direct references flagged as _strong_ (see [approval switch](#Approval_switch)). Messages are linked with each other through cryptographic hashes.
The acyclicity condition means that there is no directed cycle composed of weak or strong edges.

## 4.1.2 Definitions

In this section we provide some useful terminology which is useful to understand the basic elements of the protocol.

### 4.1.2.1 Approval switch

Here we present the set of rules, called _approval switch_, which allow nodes to alternatively approve single messages or the entire past cone of a message.
 
* **Approvers**: If a message $x$ has a directed strong (resp. weak) edge to $y$, $x$ is the _strong_ (resp. _weak_) _approver_ of $y$. More generally, we say that a message $x$ _strongly approves_ $y$ if there is a directed path of strong edges from $x$ to $y$, and $x$ _(weakly) approves_ $y$ if there is a directed path of edges of any type from $x$ to $y$.

* **Parent**: We say that $y$ is _strong_ (resp. _weak_) _parent_ of a message $x$ if $x$ has a directed strong (resp. weak) edge to $y$. Each message has a possible number of parents from 2 to 8 with repetitions (with 2 as a default value), where at least one is a strong parent.

* **Past cone**: We say that the _strong past cone_ of $x$ is the set of all messages strongly approved by $x$, and the past cone_ of $x$ is the set of all messages weakly or strongly approved by $x$. 
  
* **Future cone**: We define the _future cone_ of a message $x$ as the set of messages that weakly or strongly approve $x$. Please note that, unlike its past cone, the future cone of a message changes over time.

* **Genesis**: The genesis is the message that creates the entire token supply. Note that this implies that no other tokens will ever be created or, equivalently, no mining occurs. This message has no outgoing edges and is in the weak past cone of every other message.

In short, strong approvals are equivalent to the approvals in the legacy IOTA: if $x$ strongly approves $y$, it approves also $y$'s past cone. Moreover, weak approvals emulate the [White Flag](https://github.com/iotaledger/protocol-rfcs/blob/master/text/0005-white-flag/0005-white-flag.md) approach from Chrysalis: approving a message does not necessarily approve its past cone. This feature allows, for instance, two conflicting messages to be part of the Tangle without creating unmergeable branches.

### 4.1.2.2 Validity

This section introduces the definitions of validity for transactions and messages.

*  **(Transaction) Validity**: A transaction is valid if it passes the syntactical filter and its references are valid (see Section 2.3 - Payloads Layout for information):
   *  It is syntactically correct
   *  Unblock conditions are met (see [UTXO](utxo) for further information)
   *  Balances are zero
   *  No conflicts in the past cone (on the UTXO DAG)

* **(Message) Individual Validity**: A message is considered individually valid if it passes all the objective filters, i.e. the ones included in the Message Parser (see Section 2.4 - Data Flow):
  * It is syntactically correct
  * Its signature is valid

* **(Message) Weak Validity**: A message is weakly valid if:

  * Its Individually Valid.
  * Its parents are weakly valid.
  * Its transaction is Valid.
  * It passes the Parent Age Check.

* **(Message) Strong Validity**: A message is strongly valid if:
  * It is weakly valid.
  * Its strong parents do not have a conflicting past.
  * Its strong parents are strongly valid.

### 4.1.2.3 Branch

* **Branch**: A non-conflicting collection of past cones of outputs in the UTXO DAG.

* **Conflict branch**: A conflict branch is a branch that was formed by a double spend. In other words, a conflict branch represents a single conflict $A$, besides any conflict in the past cone of $A$.

* **Aggregated Branch**: An aggregated branch is a branch that was formed by either a transaction spending funds dependent on more than one conflict or a message approving more than one conflict. Thus, all branches that are not conflict branches will be aggregated branches. 

* **Liked Transaction**: A transaction is considered liked if its aggregated branch achieved grade 2 final status (discussion about grades of finality in Section x.x - ).

* **Individually Liked Branch**: A branch is individually liked if all conflicts that constitute its aggregated branch are liked transactions.

* **Monotonically Liked Branch**: A branch is monotonically liked if it and all the branches in its branch past are individually liked branches.

* **Monotonically Liked Message**: A message is monotonically liked if its aggregated branch is monotonically liked.

In other words, the branch of a message is an identifier of the conflicts approved by this message. Analogously, two transactions belong to the same branch if the set of conflicts in each of the transactions' UTXO past cone is the same. Thus, the branch of a transaction is an identifier of the conflicts in the UTXO past cone of this transaction. A branch can be either a conflict branch or an aggregated branch.

### 4.1.2.2 Solidification

Due to the asynchronicity of the network, we may receive messages for which their past cone has missing elements. We refer to these messages as _unsolid_ messages. It is not possible neither to approve nor to gossip unsolid messages. The actions required to obtain such missing messages is called _solidification procedure_, and are described in detail in Section 4.4 - Solidification.

### 4.1.2.3 Example

In the figure below it is shown an example of the Tangle (strong edges are with a continuous line, weak edges are with a dotted line). Message $D$ contains a transaction that has been rejected. Thus, in the legacy IOTA, its future cone must be orphaned due to the monotonicity rule. In particular, both messages $E$ (data) and $F$ (transaction) directly reference $D$. In Coordicide, the introduction of weak/strong approvals allows that these messages can be picked up via a weak approval, as messages $G$ and $H$ show.
