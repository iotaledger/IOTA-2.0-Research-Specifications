## Ledger State
### UTXO

Models:
* Address
* Outputs
* Transactions reference outputs


The unspent transaction output (UTXO) model defines a ledger state where balances are not directly associated to addresses but to the outputs of transactions. In this model, transactions specify the outputs of previous transactions as inputs, which are consumed in order to create new outputs. A transaction must consume the entirety of the specified inputs.

Using an UTXO based model provides several benefits:

Parallel validation of transactions.
Easier double-spend detection, since conflicting transactions would reference the same UTXO.
Replay-protection which is especially important when having reusable addresses. Replaying the same transaction would manifest itself as already being applied or existent and thus not have any impact.
Technically seen, balances may no longer be associated to addresses which raises the level of abstraction and thus enables other types of outputs. Consider for example a type of output which specifies the balance to be unlocked by a transaction which must fulfill a very hard Proof-of-Work difficulty or supply some other unlock criteria etc.
Within a transaction using UTXOs, inputs and outputs make up the to be signed data of the transaction. The section unlocking the inputs is called unlock block. An unlock block may contain a signature proving ownership of a given input's address and/or other unlock criteria.

The following image depicts the flow of funds using UTXO:

The way UTXOs are referenced is further described in the <i>Structure</i> section of this RFC.

#### Structure

##### Serialized Layout

A <i>Transaction Payload</i> payload is made up of two parts:
1. The <i>Transaction Essence</i> part which contains the inputs, outputs and an optional embedded payload.
2. The <i>Unlock Blocks</i> which unlock the <i>Transaction Essence</i>'s inputs. In case the unlock block contains a signature, it signs the entire <i>Transaction Essence</i> part.

All values are serialized in little-endian encoding. The serialized form of the transaction is deterministic, meaning the same logical transaction always results in the same serialized byte sequence.

Following table structure describes the entirety of a <i>Transaction Payload</i>'s serialized form:

##### Transaction Parts

In general, all parts of a <i>Transaction Payload</i> begin with a byte describing the type of the given part in order to keep the flexibility to introduce new types/versions of the given part in the future.

###### Transaction Essence Data

As described, the <i>Transaction Essence</i> of a <i>Transaction Payload</i> carries the inputs, outputs and an optional payload. The <i>Transaction Essence</i> is an explicit type and therefore starts with its own <i>Transaction Essence Type</i> byte which is of value 0.

A <i>Transaction Essence</i> must contain at least one input and output.

###### Inputs

The <i>Inputs</i> part holds the inputs to consume, respectively to fund the outputs of the <i>Transaction Essence</i>. There is only one type of input as of now, the <i>UTXO Input</i>. In the future, more types of inputs may be specified as part of protocol upgrades.

Each defined input must be accompanied by a corresponding <i>Unlock Block</i> at the same index in the <i>Unlock Blocks</i> part of the <i>Transaction Payload</i>. 
If multiple inputs can be unlocked through the same <i>Unlock Block</i>, then the given <i>Unlock Block</i> only needs to be specified at the index of the first input which gets unlocked by it. 
Subsequent inputs which are unlocked through the same data must have a <i>Reference Unlock Block</i> pointing to the previous <i>Unlock Block</i>. 
This ensures that no duplicate data needs to occur in the same transaction.

###### UTXO Input

<details>
    <summary>UTXO Input</summary>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <td><b>Name</b></td>
            <td><b>Type</b></td>
            <td><b>Description</b></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Input Type</td>
            <td>uint8</td>
            <td>
                Set to <strong>value 0</strong> to denote an <i>UTXO Input</i>.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Transaction ID</td>
            <td>Array&lt;byte&gt;[32]</td>
            <td>The BLAKE2b-256 hash of the transaction from which the UTXO comes from.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Transaction Output Index</td>
            <td>uint16</td>
            <td>The index of the output on the referenced transaction to consume.</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
</details>
<p></p>

An <i>UTXO Input</i> is an input which references an output of a previous transaction by using the given transaction's BLAKE2b-256 hash + the index of the output on that transaction. An <i>UTXO Input</i> must be accompanied by an <i>Unlock Block</i> for the corresponding type of output the <i>UTXO Input</i> is referencing.

Example: If the output the input references outputs to an Ed25519 address, then the corresponding unlock block must be of type <i>Signature Unlock Block</i> holding an Ed25519 signature.

###### Outputs

The <i>Outputs</i> part holds the outputs to create with this <i>Transaction Payload</i>. There is only one type of output as of now, the <i>SigLockedSingleOutput</i>.

###### SigLockedSingleOutput

<details>
    <summary>SigLockedSingleOutput</summary>

        </tr>
    </table>
</details>

<p></p>

The <i>SigLockedSingleOutput</i> defines an output (with a certain amount) to a single target address which is unlocked via a signature proving ownership over the given address. Such output can hold addresses of different types.

###### Payload

The payload part of a <i>Transaction Essence</i> can hold an optional payload. This payload does not affect the validity of the <i>Transaction Essence</i>. If the transaction is not valid, then the payload must also be discarded.

Supported payload types to be embedded into a <i>Transaction Essence</i>:

| Name                  | Type Value |
| --------------------- | ---------- |
| Indexation Payload    | 2          |

###### Unlock Blocks

The <i>Unlock Blocks</i> part holds the unlock blocks unlocking inputs within an <i>Transaction Essence</i>.

There are different types of <i>Unlock Blocks</i>:
<table>
    <tr>
        <td><b>Name</b></td>
        <td><b>Value</b></td>
        <td><b>Description</b></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Signature Unlock Block</td>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>An unlock block holding one or more signatures unlocking one or more inputs.</td>
    </tr>
<tr>
        <td>Reference Unlock Block</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>An unlock block which must reference a previous unlock block which unlocks also the input at the same index as this <i>Reference Unlock Block</i>.</td>
    </tr>
</table>

A <i>Signature Unlock Block</i> defines an <i>Unlock Block</i> which holds one or more signatures unlocking one or more inputs.
Such block signs the entire <i>Transaction Essence</i> part of a <i>Transaction Payload</i> including the optional payload.

A <i>Reference Unlock Block</i> defines an <i>Unlock Block</i> which references a previous <i>Unlock Block</i> (which must not be another <i>Reference Unlock Block</i>). It must be used if multiple inputs can be unlocked through the same origin <i>Unlock Block</i>.

Example:
Consider an <i>Transaction Essence</i> containing <i>UTXO Inputs</i> A, B and C, where A and C are both spending the UTXOs originating from the same Ed25519 address. The <i>Unlock Block</i> part must thereby have following structure:

| Index | Must Contain                                                                                                         |
| ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0     | A <i>Signature Unlock Block</i> holding the corresponding Ed25519 signature to unlock A and C.                    |
| 1     | A <i>Signature Unlock Block</i> which unlocks B.                                                                 |
| 2     | A <i>Reference Unlock Block</i> which references index 0, since C also gets unlocked by the same signature as A. |

##### Validation

A <i>Transaction Payload</i> payload has different validation stages, since some validation steps can only be executed at the point when certain information has (or has not) been received. We therefore distinguish between syntactical- and semantic validation.

##### Syntactical Validation

This validation can commence as soon as the transaction data has been received in its entirety. It validates the structure but not the signatures of the transaction. If the transaction does not pass this stage, it must not be further broadcasted and can be discarded right away.

Following criteria defines whether the transaction passes the syntactical validation:
* `Transaction Essence Type` value must be 0, denoting an `Transaction Essence`.
* Inputs:
    * `Inputs Count` must be 0 < x < 127.
    * At least one input must be specified.
    * `Input Type` value must be 0, denoting an `UTXO Input`.
    * `UTXO Input`:
        * `Transaction Output Index` must be 0 ≤ x < 127.
        * Every combination of `Transaction ID` + `Transaction Output Index` must be unique in the inputs set.
    * Inputs must be in lexicographical order of their serialized form.<sup>1</sup>
* Outputs:
    * `Outputs Count` must be 0 < x < 127.
    * At least one output must be specified.
    * `Output Type` must be 0, denoting a `SigLockedSingleOutput`.
    * `SigLockedSingleOutput`:
        * `Address Type` must either be 0 or 1, denoting a `BLS`- or `Ed25519` address .
        * The `Address` must be unique in the set of `SigLockedSingleOutputs`.
        * `Amount` must be > 0.
    * Outputs must be in lexicographical order by their serialized form.<sup>1</sup>
    * Accumulated output balance must not exceed the total supply of tokens `2'779'530'283'277'761`.
* `Payload Length` must be 0 (to indicate that there's no payload) or be valid for the specified payload type.
* `Payload Type` must be one of the supported payload types if `Payload Length` is not 0.
* `Unlock Blocks Count` must match the amount of inputs. Must be 0 < x < 127.
* `Unlock Block Type` must either be 0 or 1, denoting a `Signature Unlock Block` or `Reference Unlock block`.
* `Signature Unlock Blocks` must define either an `Ed25519`- or `BLS Signature`.
* A `Signature Unlock Block` unlocking multiple inputs must only appear once (be unique) and be positioned at same index of the first input it unlocks. All other inputs unlocked by the same `Signature Unlock Block` must have a companion `Reference Unlock Block` at the same index as the corresponding input which points to the origin `Signature Unlock Block`.
* `Reference Unlock Blocks` must specify a previous `Unlock Block` which is not of type `Reference Unlock Block`. The reference index must therefore be < the index of the `Reference Unlock Block`.
* Given the type and length information, the <i>Transaction Payload</i> must consume the entire byte array the `Payload Length` field in the <i>Message</i> defines.

<sup>1</sup> ensures that serialization of the transaction becomes deterministic, meaning that libraries always produce the same bytes given the logical transaction.

##### Semantic Validation

TODO: intro

Following criteria defines whether the transaction passes the semantic validation:
1. The UTXOs the transaction references must be known (booked) and unspent.
1. The transaction is spending the entirety of the funds of the referenced UTXOs to the outputs.
1. The address type of the referenced UTXO must match the signature type contained in the corresponding <i>Signature Unlock Block</i>.
1. The <i>Signature Unlock Blocks</i> are valid, i.e. the signatures prove ownership over the addresses of the referenced UTXOs.

If a transaction passes the semantic validation, its referenced UTXOs must be marked as spent and the corresponding new outputs must be booked/specified in the ledger. 

Transactions which do not pass semantic validation are ignored. Their UTXOs are not marked as spent and neither are their outputs booked into the ledger.


### Parallel reality based ledger state 
Coordinate branches with UTXO

Tha Tangle uses the ledger state to assign brancheIDs to the messages -> use Hans' picture as an example

To pickup messages, explain/refer to approval switch (msgs belonging to not like branches could be picked up by an approval switch)

* Rules to assign branchID
    * How it's defined: it's the transaction ID (unique perception of the ledger state after a double spend)
    * how it's inheritated
    * how can be merged
    * how can be absorbed by the master branch
    * how to clean up
    * approval switch related interdependencies

* Branches (Ledger state)
    * each output and transaction have an associated branch ID

Entity that manages the conflicting perception of the ledger state


* Double spend definition
    * solidity, already spent and other properties are provided by the UTXO

* IDEA: link msgID and outputID -> this way you can request missing transactions easily (i.e., same as solidification) 

The parallel reality based ledger state is a data structure that models the different perceptions of the ledger state that exist in the tangle. It enables nodes to know which sub-tangles exist, where they split, how they relate to each other, if they can be merged and which messages are valid tips. All of this information can be retrieved in a fast and efficient way without having to walk the tangle.

It consists of different layers - the UTXO DAG, its corresponding branch DAG and the tangle which projects the information from the UTXO layer onto the messages.

#### The UTXO DAG (extending UTXO with branches)

The UTXO DAG models the relationship between transactions and has the task to detect double spends and determine which conflicting versions of the ledger state exist in the presence of conflicts.

##### Detecting double spends

We maintain a list of consumers associated with every output, that keeps track of which transactions have spent that particular output. Outputs without consumers are considered to be unspent outputs. Transactions that consume an output that has more than one consumer are considered to be double spends.

##### Master branch & conflict branches

The UTXO model and the concept of solidity makes all non-conflicting transactions converge to the same ledger state no matter in which order the transactions are received. Messages containing these transactions could always reference each other in the tangle without limitations.

Every double spend however creates a new possible version of the ledger state that will no longer converge. Whenever a double spend is detected, we track the outputs created by the conflicting transactions and all of the transactions that spend these outputs separated from the rest by creating a container for them in the ledger which we call a conflict branch.

Every conflict branch is identified by the identifier of the double spending transaction. Outputs inside a branch can be double spent again, recursively forming sub-branches.

The non-conflicting transactions form the master branch.

##### Conflict sets

Branches that were created by transactions spending the same output form a conflict set. Every conflict set is identified by the identifier of the output that was spent multiple times. A branch that was created by a transaction that spends multiple outputs can be part of multiple conflict sets.

##### Aggregated branches

If outputs from multiple non-conflicting branches are spent in the same transaction, then the transaction and its resulting outputs are part of an aggregated branch which is not part of any conflict set but simply combines the perception that the conflict branches associated to the transactions inputs are the ones that will be accepted by the network.

Aggregated branches have no further branches as their children and are simply an entity that allows us to encapsulate the opinion about multiple pending conflicts at the same time (as expressed by the corresponding transaction). A conflicting transaction that spends funds from an aggregated branch will create a conflict branch that directly references the conflicts it relies on and will be its own independent entity

To calculate the identifier of aggregated branches, we take the identifiers of the branches that were aggregated, sort them lexicographically and hash the concatenated identifiers once:

```golang
// AggregatedBranchID returns the identifier for an aggregated branch.
func AggregatedBranchID(branchIDs ...BranchID) BranchID {
    return Hash(SortBranchIDS(branchIDS...)...)
}
```

###### Example

The following diagram shows an example of a UTXO DAG with several conflicts and their corresponding branches:


This DAG looks pretty complex, but it is an emergent complexity and the rules that create it are relatively simple.

Every transaction can instantly be associated with a branch on solidification. The algorithms that are required to calculate to which branch a transaction and its outputs belong are defined in a later section. We store the corresponding branch identifier together with every output and the transaction metadata to enable instant lookups of this information.

#### The branch DAG

The branches of the UTXO DAG can be modeled as a DAG with the master branch at its root and the conflict branches and the aggregated branches as its children. A branch that is created by a transaction spending outputs from other branches has edges pointing to those branches in the DAG.

This DAG is called the branch DAG and it has the same branches as the UTXO DAG but ignores the structure inside the branches which are formed by the transactions and the outputs they spend.

##### Detecting conflicting branches

The branch DAG can be used to check if branches are conflicting which in turn can be used to identify messages or transactions that are trying to introduce an invalid perception of the ledger state by combining branches belonging to conflicting double spends.

Branches are conflicting if they or any of their ancestors are part of the same conflict set.

##### Example

The branch DAG of the previous example looks like this:


*Note: We only need to keep information about branches that are still pending or not too old. If a branch has been confirmed then all of its outputs and transactions can be merged back into the master branch and the rejected branches can be discarded. This mechanism will keep the branch DAG relatively shallow and the algorithms efficient.*

#### Algorithms

In the following section we will introduce some of the most important algorithms that are required to maintain the UTXO DAG, the branch DAG and the tangle.

##### Determine conflict branches from set of branches

The first algorithm we introduce is a utility function that takes a list of branches and returns a unique set of conflict branches that these branches represent (by getting rid of duplicates and by resolving aggregated branches).

```golang
// ConflictBranches returns a unique list of conflict branches that the given branches represent.
func ConflictBranches(branches ...*Branch) map[BranchID]*Branch {
    result := make(map[BranchID]*Branch)
    for _, branch := range branches {
        if branch.IsConflictBranch() {
            result[branch.ID()] = branch

            continue
        }

        for _, parentBranch := range branch.ParentBranches() {
            result[parentBranch.ID()] = parentBranch
        }
    }

    return result
}
```

##### Normalizing branches

Since branches represent the ledger state associated with a double spend and sub-branches implicitly share the perception of their parents, we define an operation to normalize a list of branches that gets rid of all superfluous ancestors from a given list of branches. The function returns an error if the branches are conflicting and can not be merged.

```golang
// NormalizeBranches checks if the branches are conflicting and removes superfluous ancestors.
func NormalizeBranches(branches ...*Branch) (map[BranchID]*Branch, error) {
    conflictBranches := branchManager.ConflictBranches(branches...)
    if len(conflictBranches) == 1 {
        return conflictBranches, nil
    } else if len(conflictBranches) == 0 {
        return map[BranchID]*Branch{MasterBranchID: MasterBranch}, nil
    }

    traversedBranches := set.New()
    seenConflictSets := set.New()
    parentsToCheck := stack.New()

    checkConflictsAndQueueParents := func(currentBranch *Branch) error {
        if !traversedBranches.Add(currentBranch.ID()) {
            return nil
            }

        for conflictSetID := range currentBranch.Conflicts() {
            if !seenConflictSets.Add(conflictSetID) {
                return errors.New("branches conflicting")
            }
        }

        for parentBranch := range currentBranch.ParentBranches() {
            parentsToCheck.Push(parentBranch)
        }

        return nil
    }

    normalizedBranches := make(map[BranchID]*Branch)
    for conflictBranchID, conflictBranch := range conflictBranches {
        normalizedBranches[conflictBranchID] = conflictBranch

        if err := checkConflictsAndQueueParents(conflictBranch); err != nil {
            return nil, err
        }
    }

    for !parentsToCheck.IsEmpty() {
        parentBranch := parentsToCheck.Pop().(*Branch)

        delete(normalizedBranches, parentBranch.ID())

        if err := checkConflictsAndQueueParents(parentBranch); err != nil {
            return nil, err
        }
    }

    return normalizedBranches, nil
}
```

##### Inheriting branches of transactions

To be able to associate transactions and their outputs to a particular branch on solidification we introduce a method that allows them to inherit the branches of their consumed inputs according to the previously described rules. 

```golang
func InheritBranchOfTransaction(tx *Transaction) *Branch, error) {
    consumedBranches := make([]*Branch, 0)
    for _, outputID := range tx.Inputs() {
        consumedBranches = append(consumedBranches, utxoDAG.Output(outputID).Branch())
    }

    normalizedBranches, err := NormalizeBranches(consumedBranches...)
    if err != nil {
        return
    }
    normalizedBranchIDs := make([]BranchID, 0)
    for branchID := range normalizedBranches {
        normalizedBranchIDs = append(normalizedBranchIDs, branchID)
    }

    conflictingInputs := tx.ConflictingInputs()
    if len(conflictingInputs) != 0 {
        return CreateConflictBranch(tx.ID(), normalizedBranchIDs..., conflictingInputs...), nil
    }

    if len(normalizedBranchIDs) == 1 {
        return GetBranch(normalizedBranchIDs[0]), nil
    }

    aggregatedBranchID := AggregatedBranchID(normalizedBranchIDs...)
    if aggregatedBranch := GetBranch(aggregatedBranchID); aggregatedBranch != nil {
        return aggregatedBranch, nil
    }

    return CreateAggregatedBranch(aggregatedBranchID, normalizedBranchIDs...)
}
```
