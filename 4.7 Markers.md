# 4.7.1 Markers

This section defines the *Marker* tool.

# 4.7.2 Motivation

For certain applications we need to know, whether a certain message is in the past or future cone of another message. Furthemrore, in order to compute the approval weight of a given message we need to traverse the Tangle from the message to the tips and sum up the active consensus mana of all the messages in its future cone. These operations can be numerically expensive.

The marker tool allows to efficiently determine whether certain markers are in the past or future cone of a given message, by reducing the proportion of the Tangle that needs to be traversed. Thus reducing significantly the effort to identify wether certain messages are in the past or future cone of another message. It also enables to efficiently estimate the approval weight of a message.

# Definitions

Let's define the terms related to markers:
* **Marker:** A transaction that locally is assigned additional properties and that tracks a particular UTXO branch.
* **Marker Rank (MR):** The rank of a marker in the marker DAG.
* **Sequence:** A Sequence is a sequence of markers, where each marker corresponds to same UTXO branch.
* **Sequence Identifier (SI):** A Sequence Identifier is the unique identifier of a Sequence. 
* **Sequence rank (SR):** The rank of a sequence in the sequence DAG.
* **Future marker (FM):** A future marker of a message is the first marker in its future cone from different sequences; this field in the message metadata is updated when the new marker is generated in the future, following the rules defined in (#future-markers).
* **Past marker (PM):** A past marker of a message is a marker in its past cone. For a given sequence it is set to the newest past marker of its parents, that is the one that has the largest MR. The past marker of a marker is set to itself.

## The Markers

Markers are messages selected from the tip set periodically and assigned unique identifiers, in the form of $[SI, MR]$.

A new marker is created when: 
* more than a certain number of messages have been received since the last marker.
* a certain time window has passed.
* a new sequence is created.
