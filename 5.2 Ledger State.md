## 5.2 Ledger State


The introduction of a voting-based consensus requires a fast and easy way to determine a node's initial opinion for every received transaction. This includes the ability to both detect double spends and transactions that try to spend non-existing funds. These conditions are fulfilled by the introduction of a Unspent Transaction Output (**UTXO**) model for record-keeping, which enables the validation of transactions in real time, see also the section on [UTXO](5.1%20UTXO.md).

To deal with double spends and leverage on certain properties of UTXO, we introduce the “reality based ledger state”. 

### 5.2.1 Reality Based Ledger State 

In the Reality Based Ledger State, we model the different perceptions of the ledger state that exist in the Tangle. In each “reality” on its own there are zero conflicting transactions, and the composition of all realities defines the Reality Based Ledger State. Nodes are thus enabled to know which possible outcomes for the Tangle exist, where they split, how they relate to each other, if they can be merged and which messages are valid tips. All of this information can be retrieved in a fast and efficient way without having to walk the Tangle. 

### 5.2.1 UTXO branches 

The concept of UTXO style transactions is directly linked to the creation of a directed acyclic graph (**DAG**), in which the vertices are transactions and the links between these are determined by the outputs and inputs of transactions, see also the section on [UTXO](5.1%20UTXO.md). 

Since outputs of transactions can only be consumed once, a transaction that double spend outputs creates a persistent branch in a corresponding UTXO DAG, each receiving a unique branchID. These branches cannot be merged by any vertices (transactions). It is then up to the consensus protocol to determine which branch is the correct one. 

We apply the rule that a message inherits the branches of its parents. This allows nodes, by attaching to certain branches, to effectively make their opinions public about which parts of the Tangle they consider to be valid, see also [Tip Selection ???](). From a more practical point of view transactions have a certain amount of approval weight that is tide to the mana of the node that issued a given transaction. The [approval weight???]() of a message can then be propagated monotonically towards its indirectly referenced messages. 

Individual nodes can then only add their approval weight to branches which they consider to be the correct branch. However, it would then be possible that messages cannot gain approval weight if they attach to the wrong part of the Tangle. To overcome this limitation, we introduce the concept of weak reference, with which the approval weight is only assigned to the referenced message and thus the branch of that message itself, see section [approval switch](???).

A new branch and branchID is assigned according to the following rules:

* Rules to assign branchID
    * How it's defined: it's the transaction ID (unique perception of the ledger state after a double spend)
    * how it's inherited
    * how can be merged
    * how can be absorbed by the master branch
    * how to clean up
    * approval switch related interdependencies

* Branches (Ledger state)
    * each output and transaction have an associated branch ID

Entity that manages the conflicting perception of the ledger state


* Double spend definition
    * solidity, already spent and other properties are provided by the UTXO

* IDEA: link msgID and outputID -> this way you can request missing transactions easily (i.e., same as solidification) 

The parallel reality based ledger state is a data structure that models the different perceptions of the ledger state that exist in the tangle. It enables nodes to know which sub-tangles exist, where they split, how they relate to each other, if they can be merged and which messages are valid tips. All of this information can be retrieved in a fast and efficient way without having to walk the tangle.

It consists of different layers - the UTXO DAG, its corresponding branch DAG and the tangle which projects the information from the UTXO layer onto the messages.

#### The UTXO DAG (extending UTXO with branches)

The UTXO DAG models the relationship between transactions and has the task to detect double spends and determine which conflicting versions of the ledger state exist in the presence of conflicts.

##### Detecting double spends

We maintain a list of consumers associated with every output, that keeps track of which transactions have spent that particular output. Outputs without consumers are considered to be unspent outputs. Transactions that consume an output that has more than one consumer are considered to be double spends.

##### Master branch & conflict branches

The UTXO model and the concept of solidity makes all non-conflicting transactions converge to the same ledger state no matter in which order the transactions are received. Messages containing these transactions could always reference each other in the tangle without limitations.

Every double spend however creates a new possible version of the ledger state that will no longer converge. Whenever a double spend is detected, we track the outputs created by the conflicting transactions and all of the transactions that spend these outputs separated from the rest by creating a container for them in the ledger which we call a conflict branch.

Every conflict branch is identified by the identifier of the double spending transaction. Outputs inside a branch can be double spent again, recursively forming sub-branches.

The non-conflicting transactions form the master branch.

##### Conflict sets

Branches that were created by transactions spending the same output form a conflict set. Every conflict set is identified by the identifier of the output that was spent multiple times. A branch that was created by a transaction that spends multiple outputs can be part of multiple conflict sets.

##### Aggregated branches

If outputs from multiple non-conflicting branches are spent in the same transaction, then the transaction and its resulting outputs are part of an aggregated branch which is not part of any conflict set but simply combines the perception that the conflict branches associated to the transactions inputs are the ones that will be accepted by the network.

Aggregated branches have no further branches as their children and are simply an entity that allows us to encapsulate the opinion about multiple pending conflicts at the same time (as expressed by the corresponding transaction). A conflicting transaction that spends funds from an aggregated branch will create a conflict branch that directly references the conflicts it relies on and will be its own independent entity

To calculate the identifier of aggregated branches, we take the identifiers of the branches that were aggregated, sort them lexicographically and hash the concatenated identifiers once:

```golang
// AggregatedBranchID returns the identifier for an aggregated branch.
func AggregatedBranchID(branchIDs ...BranchID) BranchID {
    return Hash(SortBranchIDS(branchIDS...)...)
}
```

###### Example

The following diagram shows an example of a UTXO DAG with several conflicts and their corresponding branches:


This DAG looks pretty complex, but it is an emergent complexity and the rules that create it are relatively simple.

Every transaction can instantly be associated with a branch on solidification. The algorithms that are required to calculate to which branch a transaction and its outputs belong are defined in a later section. We store the corresponding branch identifier together with every output and the transaction metadata to enable instant lookups of this information.

#### The branch DAG

The branches of the UTXO DAG can be modeled as a DAG with the master branch at its root and the conflict branches and the aggregated branches as its children. A branch that is created by a transaction spending outputs from other branches has edges pointing to those branches in the DAG.

This DAG is called the branch DAG and it has the same branches as the UTXO DAG but ignores the structure inside the branches which are formed by the transactions and the outputs they spend.

##### Detecting conflicting branches

The branch DAG can be used to check if branches are conflicting which in turn can be used to identify messages or transactions that are trying to introduce an invalid perception of the ledger state by combining branches belonging to conflicting double spends.

Branches are conflicting if they or any of their ancestors are part of the same conflict set.

##### Example

The branch DAG of the previous example looks like this:


*Note: We only need to keep information about branches that are still pending or not too old. If a branch has been confirmed then all of its outputs and transactions can be merged back into the master branch and the rejected branches can be discarded. This mechanism will keep the branch DAG relatively shallow and the algorithms efficient.*

#### Algorithms

In the following section we will introduce some of the most important algorithms that are required to maintain the UTXO DAG, the branch DAG and the tangle.

##### Determine conflict branches from set of branches

The first algorithm we introduce is a utility function that takes a list of branches and returns a unique set of conflict branches that these branches represent (by getting rid of duplicates and by resolving aggregated branches).

```golang
// ConflictBranches returns a unique list of conflict branches that the given branches represent.
func ConflictBranches(branches ...*Branch) map[BranchID]*Branch {
    result := make(map[BranchID]*Branch)
    for _, branch := range branches {
        if branch.IsConflictBranch() {
            result[branch.ID()] = branch

            continue
        }

        for _, parentBranch := range branch.ParentBranches() {
            result[parentBranch.ID()] = parentBranch
        }
    }

    return result
}
```

##### Normalizing branches

Since branches represent the ledger state associated with a double spend and sub-branches implicitly share the perception of their parents, we define an operation to normalize a list of branches that gets rid of all superfluous ancestors from a given list of branches. The function returns an error if the branches are conflicting and can not be merged.

```golang
// NormalizeBranches checks if the branches are conflicting and removes superfluous ancestors.
func NormalizeBranches(branches ...*Branch) (map[BranchID]*Branch, error) {
    conflictBranches := branchManager.ConflictBranches(branches...)
    if len(conflictBranches) == 1 {
        return conflictBranches, nil
    } else if len(conflictBranches) == 0 {
        return map[BranchID]*Branch{MasterBranchID: MasterBranch}, nil
    }

    traversedBranches := set.New()
    seenConflictSets := set.New()
    parentsToCheck := stack.New()

    checkConflictsAndQueueParents := func(currentBranch *Branch) error {
        if !traversedBranches.Add(currentBranch.ID()) {
            return nil
            }

        for conflictSetID := range currentBranch.Conflicts() {
            if !seenConflictSets.Add(conflictSetID) {
                return errors.New("branches conflicting")
            }
        }

        for parentBranch := range currentBranch.ParentBranches() {
            parentsToCheck.Push(parentBranch)
        }

        return nil
    }

    normalizedBranches := make(map[BranchID]*Branch)
    for conflictBranchID, conflictBranch := range conflictBranches {
        normalizedBranches[conflictBranchID] = conflictBranch

        if err := checkConflictsAndQueueParents(conflictBranch); err != nil {
            return nil, err
        }
    }

    for !parentsToCheck.IsEmpty() {
        parentBranch := parentsToCheck.Pop().(*Branch)

        delete(normalizedBranches, parentBranch.ID())

        if err := checkConflictsAndQueueParents(parentBranch); err != nil {
            return nil, err
        }
    }

    return normalizedBranches, nil
}
```

##### Inheriting branches of transactions

To be able to associate transactions and their outputs to a particular branch on solidification we introduce a method that allows them to inherit the branches of their consumed inputs according to the previously described rules. 

```golang
func InheritBranchOfTransaction(tx *Transaction) *Branch, error) {
    consumedBranches := make([]*Branch, 0)
    for _, outputID := range tx.Inputs() {
        consumedBranches = append(consumedBranches, utxoDAG.Output(outputID).Branch())
    }

    normalizedBranches, err := NormalizeBranches(consumedBranches...)
    if err != nil {
        return
    }
    normalizedBranchIDs := make([]BranchID, 0)
    for branchID := range normalizedBranches {
        normalizedBranchIDs = append(normalizedBranchIDs, branchID)
    }

    conflictingInputs := tx.ConflictingInputs()
    if len(conflictingInputs) != 0 {
        return CreateConflictBranch(tx.ID(), normalizedBranchIDs..., conflictingInputs...), nil
    }

    if len(normalizedBranchIDs) == 1 {
        return GetBranch(normalizedBranchIDs[0]), nil
    }

    aggregatedBranchID := AggregatedBranchID(normalizedBranchIDs...)
    if aggregatedBranch := GetBranch(aggregatedBranchID); aggregatedBranch != nil {
        return aggregatedBranch, nil
    }

    return CreateAggregatedBranch(aggregatedBranchID, normalizedBranchIDs...)
}
```
