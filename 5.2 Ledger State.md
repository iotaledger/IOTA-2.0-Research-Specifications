# 5.2 Ledger State

The introduction of a voting-based consensus requires a fast and easy way to determine a node's initial opinion for every received transaction. This includes the ability to both detect double spends and transactions that try to spend non-existing funds. 
These conditions are fulfilled by the introduction of an Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) model for record-keeping, which enables the validation of transactions in real time, see also the section on [UTXO](5.1%20UTXO.md).

The concept of UTXO style transactions is directly linked to the creation of a directed acyclic graph (DAG), in which the vertices are transactions and the links between these are determined by the outputs and inputs of transactions. 

To deal with double spends and leverage on certain properties of UTXO, we introduce the Realities Ledger State. 

## 5.2.1 Realities Ledger State 

In the Realities Ledger State, we model the different perceptions of the ledger state that exist in the Tangle. In each “reality” on its own there are zero conflicting transactions. 
Each reality thus forms an in itself consistent UTXO sub-DAG, where every transaction references any other transaction correctly.

Since outputs of transactions can only be consumed once, a transaction that double spends outputs creates a persistent branch in a corresponding UTXO DAG. Each branch receives a unique identifier `branchID`. These branches cannot be merged by any vertices (transactions). 
A transaction that attempts to merge incompatible branches fails to pass a validity check and is marked as invalid.

The composition of all realities defines the Realities Ledger State. 

From this composition nodes are able to know which possible outcomes for the Tangle exist, where they split, how they relate to each other, if they can be merged and which messages are valid tips. All of this information can be retrieved in a fast and efficient way without having to walk the Tangle. 

Ultimately, for a set of competing realities, only one reality can survive. It is then up to the consensus protocol to determine which branch is part of the eventually accepted reality.

In total the ledger state thus involves three different layers:
* the UTXO DAG,
* its extension to the corresponding branch DAG,
* the Tangle which maps the parent relations between messages and thus also transactions.

## 5.2.2 The UTXO DAG

The UTXO DAG models the relationship between transactions, by tracking which outputs have been spent by what transaction, see also the section on [UTXO](5.1%20UTXO.md). Since outputs can only be spent once, we use this property to detect double spends. 

Instead of permitting immediately only one transaction into to the ledger state, we allow for different versions of the ledger to coexist temporarily. 
This is enabled by extending the UTXO DAG by the introduction of branches, see the following section. We can then determine which conflicting versions of the ledger state exist in the presence of conflicts.

### 5.2.2.1 Conflict sets and detection of double spends

We maintain a list of consumers `consumerList` associated with every output, that keeps track of which transactions have spent that particular output. Outputs without consumers are considered to be unspent outputs. Transactions that consume an output that have more than one consumer are considered to be double spends. 

If there is more than one consumer in the consumer list we *shall* create a conflict set list `conflictSet`, which is identical to the consumer list. The `conflictSet` is uniquely identified by the unique identifier `conflictSetID`. Since the `outputID` is directly and uniquely linked to the conflict set, we set `conflictSetID=outputID`.

## 5.2.3 Branches

The UTXO model and the concept of solidification, see section [solidification ????](), makes all non-conflicting transactions converge to the same ledger state no matter in which order the transactions are received. Messages containing these transactions could always reference each other in the Tangle without limitations.

However, every double spend creates a new possible version of the ledger state that will no longer converge. Whenever a double spend is detected, see the previous section, we track the outputs created by the conflicting transactions and all of the transactions that spend these outputs, by creating a container for them in the ledger which we call a branch. 

More specifically a container `branch` *shall* be created for each transaction that double spends one or several outputs, or if transactions aggregated those branches.
Every transaction that spends directly or indirectly from a transaction in a given `branch`, i.e. is in the future cone in the UTXO DAG of the double-spending transaction that created `branch`, is also contained in this `branch` or one of the child branches.
A branch that was created by a transaction that spends multiple outputs can be part of multiple conflict sets.

Every branch *shall* be identified by the unique identifier `branchID`. We consider two kinds of branches: conflict branches and aggregated branches, which are explained in the following sections.

### 5.2.3.1 Conflict branches 

A conflict branch is created by a corresponding double spend transaction. Since the transaction identifier is unique, we choose the transaction id `transactionID` of the double spending transaction as the `branchID`.

Outputs inside a branch can be double spent again, recursively forming sub-branches. 

On solidification of a message, we *shall* store the corresponding branch identifier together with every output, as well as the transaction metadata to enable instant lookups of this information. Thus, on solidification, a transaction can be immediately associated with a branch. 


### 5.2.3.2 Aggregated branches

A transaction that does not create a double spend inherits the branches of the input's branches. In the simplest case, where there is only one input branch the transaction inherits that branch. 

If outputs from multiple non-conflicting branches are spent in the same transaction, then the transaction and its resulting outputs are part of an aggregated branch. This type of branch is not part of any conflict set. Rather it simply combines the perception that the individual conflict branches associated to the transaction's inputs are the ones that will be accepted by the network. Each aggregated branch *shall* have a unique identifier `branchID`, which is the same type as for conflict branches. Furthermore the container for an aggregated branch is also of type `branch`. 

To calculate the unique identifier of a new aggregated branch, we take the identifiers of the branches that were aggregated, sort them lexicographically and hash the concatenated identifiers once:

```vbnet
# AggregatedBranchID returns the identifier for an aggregated branch.
FUNCTION aggregatedBranchID = GetAggregatedBranchID(branchIDs)
    sortedBranchIDs = Sort(branchIDs)
    RETURN Hash(sortedBranchIDs)
```

An aggregated branch can't aggregate other aggregated branches. However, it can aggregate the conflict branches that are part of the referenced aggregated branch. 
Thus aggregated branches have no further branches as their children and they remain tips in the branch DAG. Furthermore, the sortation of the `branchID`s in the function `AggregatedBranchID()` ensures that even though messages can attach at different points in the Tangle and aggregate different aggregated branches they are treated as if they are in the same aggregated branch **if** the referenced conflict branches are the same. 

These properties allow for an efficient reduction of a set of branches. In the following we will require the following fields as part of the branch data: 
* `isConflictBranch` is a boolean flat that is `TRUE` if the branch is a conflict branch or `FALSE` if its an aggregated branch.
* `parentBranches` contains the list of parent conflict branches of the branch, i.e. the conflict branches that are directly referenced by this branch.

Then the following function takes a list of branches (which can be either conflict or aggregated branches) and returns a unique set of conflict branches that these branches represent. This is done by replacing duplicates and extracting the parent conflict branches from aggregated branches. 


```vbnet
FUNCTION reducedBranches = ReduceBranches(branches)
    FOR branch IN branches
        IF branch.isConflictBranch
            Append(reducedBranches,branch)
        ELSE
            FOR parentBranch IN branch.parentBranches
                IF NOT (parentBranch IN reducedBranches)
                    Append(reducedBranches,parentBranch)
    
    RETURN reducedBranches
```

### 5.2.3.3 The branch DAG

A new branch is created for each transaction that is part of a conflict set, or if a transaction aggregates branches.

In the branch DAG, branches constitute the vertices of the DAG. A branch that is created by a transaction that is spending outputs from other branches has edges pointing to those branches.
The branch DAG maps the UTXO DAG to a simpler structure that ignores details about relations between transactions inside the branches and instead retains only details about the interrelations of conflicts.

The set of all non-conflicting transactions form the master branch. Thus, at its root the branch DAG has the master branch, which consists of non-conflicting transaction and resolved transactions. From this root of the branch DAG the various branches emerge. 

In other words the conflict branches and the aggregated branches appear as the children of the master branch. 

### 5.2.3.4 Detecting conflicting branches

Branches are conflicting if they, or any of their ancestors, are part of the same conflict set.

The branch DAG can be used to check if branches are conflicting, by applying an operation called normalization, to a set of input branches.

From this information we can identify messages or transactions that are trying to combine branches belonging to conflicting double spends, and thus introduce an invalid perception of the ledger state.


Since branches represent the ledger state associated with a double spend and sub-branches implicitly share the perception of their parents, we define an operation to normalize a list of branches that gets rid of all branches that are referenced by other branches in that list. The function returns `NULL` if the branches are conflicting and can not be merged.


```vbnet
GLOBAL seenConflictSets = map[]conflictSetID
GLOBAL traversedBranches = map[]branch
GLOBAL parentsToCheck = map[]branch

# check if conflicting, mark branches as traversed, remember conflictSet and queue parents
FUNCTION checkPassed = BranchCheck(branch)
    # abort if branch was traversed already
    IF branch IN traversedBranches 
        RETURN TRUE
    ELSE 
        Append(traversedBranches,branch.ID)
    # check if conflict set was seen twice
    IF branch.conflictSetID IN seenConflictSets
        RETURN FALSE
    ELSE 
        Append(seenConflictSets,branch.conflictSetID)

    # queue parents to be checked when traversing ancestors
    FOR parentBranch IN branch.parentBranches
        Append(parentsToCheck,parentBranch)
    RETURN TRUE

# reduce list of branches to normalized branches, and return NULL when detecting conflicting branches
FUNCTION normalizedBranches = NormalizeBranches(initialBranches)
    IF Len(initialBranches) == 0
        RETURN masterBranch
    IF Len(initialBranches) == 1
        RETURN initialBranches

    # check original set of branches
    normalizedBranches = ReduceBranches(initialBranches)
    FOR branch IN normalizedBranches
        branchCheck(branch)

    # check every ancestor
    WHILE Len(parentsToCheck) != 0
        branch = parentsToCheck[0]
        Delete(parentsToCheck,branch) # delete this branch from the list
        # remove this ancestor
        IF branch IN normalizedBranches
            Delete(normalizedBranches,branch)
        # if branch check fails return a nil list
        IF NOT branchCheck(branch) 
            RETURN NULL

    RETURN normalizedBranches
```

### 5.2.3.5 Approval weight propagation

A message inherits the branches of its parents. Thus, every message references every branch in its past cone.

Thus, by attaching to certain messages the node issuing node is effectively also attaching to certain branches. This can be utilized to efficiently make their opinions public about which parts of the Tangle they consider to be valid, see also [tip selection ???](). 

We build on this by associating the latest issued message of a given node with some approval weight that is tied to the consensus mana of that node. Furthermore, this allows for certain properties, such that the [approval weight???]() of a message can be propagated monotonically towards its indirectly referenced messages. 

Individual nodes can only add their approval weight to branches which they consider to be the branch that should be accepted. However, if messages attach to the part of the Tangle that would become disqualified for the tip selection, they cannot gain enough approval weight to become confirmed. To overcome this limitation, we introduce the concept of weak reference, with which the approval weight is only assigned to the referenced message and thus the branch of that message itself, see section [approval switch???]().

### 5.2.3.6 Merging of branches into the master branch

Through the method described in the previous section, messages gain approval weight. Once the approval weight exceeds a certain threshold we consider the message as confirmed, see also section [??? approval weight]().

Once a conflicting transaction is confirmed, the winning branch in the corresponding conflict set can be merged back into the master branch. Since the approval weight is monotonically increasing for messages from the past to the future, branches are only merged into the master branch.

The loosing branches and all their children branches are booked into the container `rejectedBranch` that has the identifier `rejectedBranchID`.
